<h2>Delirium</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game explores the mind of the player under the influence of a deliriant. The player must survive the trip while facing their fears and discerning reality and hallucinations in this horror side-scroller.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Experience the unreliability of reality and think about what is helpful or not.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Horror adventure side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player is restricted to a 2-d environment, so the character’s movements are limited to jumping, moving left and right, crouching, and entering doors. The player will be able to interact with the environment, such as breaking off objects in the environment for use and entering other hidden areas of the map. There are friendly characters that the player may have conversations with. The player must also fight some enemies through either physically fighting them or walking straight through them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Unreliable objects and transformations
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
•	Stylized environment to simulate a deliriant trip
•	Sound design intended to disturb the player and further simulate a trip, e.g. voices of people who are not really there and sound distortions throughout
•	A crew of spooky enemies that are known to show up in a trip: spiders, snakes, and shadow people. 
•	Special enemy behavior, only some enemies will hurt you. The environmental elements like trees and items can turn into enemies. Enemies can phase in an out of existence.
•	Psychedelic visual distortion: bubbling, breathing, trailing patterns, color shifts
•	One-way side scrolling world to simulate the passage of time that starts normal, peaks towards the middle, and then finishes at the end
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game world is the real world, but the interesting part is that the perception will be distorted by the trip. As the player progresses through the game his/her perception of the world begins to change. The setting of a distorted world makes exploration and “mental survival” novel. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
: Joel has been having disturbed sleep for the past couple weeks. He has read that diphenhydramine helps with sleep, so one night he decides to take much more than the suggested amount. Little does he know—at high doses diphenhydramine is a deliriant capable of eliciting true hallucinations and distorting reality. Unable to undo his actions he must attempt to survive the night as he begins to hallucinate spiders and shadow people.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
An older audience that is more aware of substance abuse and the horror genre. Game content may be too mature for children and young teenagers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Around 10 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Being quick on your feet
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Built off of what was done already
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not very sure about this. Perhaps other spooky games.
